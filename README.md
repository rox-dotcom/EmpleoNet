<h1>Hi! Welcome to the EmpleoNet repository...</h1>

<h4>First of all, what is EmpleoNet?</h4>
EmpleoNet is a platform created in collaboration with the Food Bank of Guadalajara, and some students from Tec de Monterrey, campus Gdl. 
In response to Mexico's rising unemployment rates in recent years and the growing demand for employment opportunities, the Food Bank of Guadalajara (GDL) partnered with the Job Bank of Guadalajara to enhance quality of life and support those in need of work. Our initiative focused on developing a system that offers high-quality services to the public, utilizing certified professionals in various trades such as tailoring, plumbing, carpentry, electrical work, and manual labor.
